This is a simple add service that happens over a TLS connection.

To generate code from the protobuf file:
cd addservice
protoc --go_out=. addservice.proto 

To compile the server:
go build add.go

To compile the client:
go build client.go

To make test certificates:
./makecert.sh AnyFakeOrRealEmail@foo.com

To test run add the server (server is hard coded to port 8000):
$ go run ./add.go 

In another window/shell, client is hard coded to 127.0.0.1:8000:
$ go run client.go
