#1. Find a simple configuration file format and code to load it that
    supports key=value and key=list type settings.

Example:
private_key=/etc/bdr/private.key
public_key =/etc/bdr/public.key
backup_dirs = /home /etc /var/lib/mail
server = my-master-p2p.domain.com
local_sqlite = /etc/bdr/fs-meta.sql
purge_deleted_files = 30 #days
local_store = /home/bdr/blobs
queue_blobs= /var/lib/bdr
minimum_blob_replication = 4 # copies
minimum_number_of_hops = 2 # avoid peers too local

#2 file system walker - depends on #1, iterates over backup_dirs noting
      any new files, changed files, and deleted files.  Keeps state
      in sqlite (permission, size, timestamps, uid/gid).  Builds
      queue of new/changed files.

#3 Uploader depends on #1 - For each file in the queue it reads, compresses,
   and checksums it.  Ideally multiple core friendly.  As files are finished
   upload them to p2p server.

#4 P2P server - speaks the p2p protocol for trading blobs, including those
                from the uploader.  Depends on #5 protocol and #1 init file.

#5 implement code to implement p2p protocol (see protocol.txt) between
   SSL connected peers.  Connections should only be allowed to complete
   if the peer presents the public key in the sqlite database that
   tracks peers.
