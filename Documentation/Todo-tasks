=== ======    ===========

1   Unassigned Find a simple configuration file format and code to load it that
              supports key=value and key=list type settings.  See init.txt

2   Unassigned file system walker - depends on #1, iterates over backup_dirs 
               noting any new files, changed files, and deleted files.  Keeps 
               state in sqlite (permission, size, timestamps, uid/gid).  Builds
               queue of new/changed files.  See walker.txt and schema.txt.
2A  Unassigned find, download, compile, install, and build a usable test case
               for sqlite3 or similar lightweight SQL like queries

3   Unassigned Uploader depends on #1 - For each file in the queue it reads, 
               compresses, and checksums it.  Ideally multiple core friendly.  
               As files are finished upload them to p2p server.  See 
               uploader.txt.  Depends on #4 and #5 to actually upload.
3A  *DONE*     update https://github.com/wernerd/Skein3Fish to build with Go1. 
3B  *DONE*     write test code to encrypt using AES
3C  *DONE*     write test code to sha256 

4   Unassigned P2P server - speaks the p2p protocol for trading blobs, 
               including those from the uploader.  Depends on #5 protocol and 
               #1 init file.  Continuously trades blobs, makes challenges, 
               accepts challenges monitors and maintains redundancy.
4A Unassigned  get test case with a few unique blobs each to successfully 
               transfer blobs.

5  Unassigned  implement code to implement p2p protocol (see protocol.txt) 
               between SSL connected peers.  Connections should only be 
               allowed to complete if the peer presents the public key in 
               the sqlite database that tracks peers.
5A *DONE*      write go code to connect with TLS/SSL and view the other ends 
               public key
5B Unassigned  get goprotobufs built/usable with working test code
5C Unassigned  implement REQUEST, REPLY, and GET.  See protocol.txt
