Protocol should support the following commands:
* REQUEST - <number of records> 
               <256 bit checksum>
               <size>

            <number of records> legal values 1-256, represents the
                                number of blobs we are requesting 
                                storage for
            <256bit checksum> - checksum
            <size> - blob size

            The request command is sent from a peer that needs a blob
            stored to a peer that will hopefully store blob.  The listed
            blobs are under replicated, the goal is to get the peer to
            register them as yours, that way they will stay available in
            the future.  Any accepted blobs will count against my quota,
            but do NOT necessarily need to be sent.

            Note this sends a request for a peer to replicate blobs, but
            does NOT actually send them.

* REPLY - <number of records>
               <256 bit checksum>
               <reply-status>
           
           Reply allows a peer to respond to a REQUEST.  This isn't on the
           same connection.  Status should be one of:
           Status = 0   I have blob, your are now subscribed to it.
           Status = 1   I don't have that blob, please send it.
           Status = 2   I don't want that blob, try someone else
           Status = 3   I don't accept blobs that big, try someone else
           Status = 4   That violated our agreed on quota, go away
           Status = 5   That vioated our agreed on quota, but I will accept a larger quota trade.

* GET - <number of records>
            <256 checksum>
            <size>
        
        Reply should be a list of:
             <checksum>
	         <size> 
             <status>
             <contents of blob if no error>

        Status = 0 # file available and is being sent
        Status = 1 # file unavailable, try again later
        Status = 2 # file unavailable, it wasn't offered, anonymous gets are turned off.
        Status = 3 # file doesn't exist, no idea
