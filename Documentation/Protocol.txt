Protocol should support the following commands:
* Request - <number of records> 
               <skein 256 bit checksum>
               <size>

            <number of records> legal values 1-256, represents the
                                number of blobs we are requesting 
                                storage for
            <skein 256bit checksum> - checksum
            <size> - blob size

            The request command is sent between peers.  The listed blobs
            are under replicated.  Any accepted blobs will count against
            my quota, but do NOT necessarily need to be sent.  

* Accept - <number of records>
               <skein 256 bit checksum>
           
           The accept commands acknowledges that you will store the files
           requested by the peer and count them against the quote.  They
           do not necessarily require being sent.  Server sending an
           accept should follow up with a get for any missing blobs.

* get - <number of records>
            <skein 256 checksum>
            <size>
        
        Reply should be a list of:
             <skein checksum>
	         <size> 
             <status>
             <contents of blob if no error>
