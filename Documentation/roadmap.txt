Pre 1.0 - 
	Basically functionality for backing up files.
    Manual peer introductions
    Manual quotes/contracts for peer storage
    Testing use only

1.0 stable protocol/init file, gradual improvements, easy to install,
    ideally linux, windows, and osx ports.
    Usable for early adopters.

2.0 or later:
	Addition of more complex contracts, reputation.
	Multiple choices for encryption/checkumming
	Splitting of large files of MAXBLOBSIZE.
	Automated peer to peer introductions
	Potentially more advanced/efficient redundancy
	Automated requests to increase size of contract when disk is needed.
    IPv6
    Consider not trusting local filesystem timestamps/modification flags at the
    cost of substantially more CPU and disk IO.
    Lower security encryption with global dedupe by encrypting with file checksum.
