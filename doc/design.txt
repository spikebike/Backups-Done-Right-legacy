The overall design is to attempt to make a very easy to use client
that makes it feasible to backup a set of directories by trading space
with peers.

Security is a top concern.  To that end:
* Write an absolute minimal amount of encryption code, depend
  heavily on popular well tested libraries.
* Encrypt user files as soon as they are read from disk with 
  a strong encryption
* Easy to audit source code, no backdoors, no method for 
  recovery without keys.
* Use well tested libraries whenever possible, avoid writing code
  whenever possible.

Observations:
* Average file size is small
* At least on LANs (multiple peers on same lan is predicted to
  be a common use case) 60-80MB/sec connections are common
* Reading, compressing, checksumming, and encrypting at 60-80MB/sec
  is tough and requires using multiple CPUs.
* Disk space is cheap (don't try too hard to save disk space)
* Random IO on disks is often on the order of 100/second (very slow)
* In many environments deduplication is valuable

To this end 2 programs to achieve this are:
1) file system walker - has access to encryption key, tracks all
   file system state locally, maintains a per machine metadata
   sqlite database.  Any new or changed files are encrypted and
   uploaded as blobs to the p2p daemon.  Can be run out of cron or by
   users.
2) p2p daemon -
   A) tracks peers, reputation, IP address, and SSL public key
   B) challenges peers and updates reputation accordingly.
   C) accepts uploaded blobs from the filesystem walker using the
      same protocol as peers do.
   D) ensures desired redundancy of blobs
   E) accepts stores from peers.

Note the walker/uploader <-> p2p daemon protocol is identical to the p2p<->p2p
